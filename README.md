## Sinatra - RESTful states Homework

### Description of work:
For this we had to research the different RESTful states that are used in databases and websites (front-end requests to back-end). We had to implement the seven RESTful states and test that they are working using postman and use the terminal on our machines to set up our server locally to get a better understanding of how the RESTful states are requesting data from our servers.
